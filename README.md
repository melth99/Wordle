## üìù Catch 'em All!
  Pokemon Wordle is a fun twist on the popular NYT's Wordle. This game fetches Pokemon data from the PokeAPI. Each game, a Pokemon from GENI-IV is randomly selected (excluding Pokemon with names with punctuation)
  The number of tries depends on the number of letters in the selected Pokemon's name, so difficulty should not be affected by name length. Users have the option of typing on their personal keyboard or clicking on the provided virtual keyboard. Feedback is provided and each attempt is saved to prevent repeated mistakes.
